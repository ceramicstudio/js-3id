# <a name="intro"></a> 3ID-Connect

![3ID Connect Image](./assets/3id-connect_readme-image.png)

3ID Connect provides 3ID user account management in an iframe, an easy way to access a DID provider, specifically [ThreeIdProvider](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-3id-did-provider) in the browser.
It allows users to authenticate, manage, link and permission their 3ID keys to applications.

The library [js-3id-did-provider](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-3id-did-provider) handles most operations and the parent window (application) communicates with the iframe service over an RPC layer.

## Getting started

### Installation

```sh
npm install @3id/connect
```

### Basic usage

```ts
import { EthereumAuthProvider, ThreeIdConnect } from '@3id/connect'

// ethProvider is an Ethereum provider and addresses an array of strings
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(ethProvider, addresses[0])

const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)
```

See the [example app](./apps/example) for more details
